# School_of_Emerging_Technologies
This project involved creating a responsive website for the School of Emerging Technologies with a modern, tech-focused design. I approached the development in several key phases:

# Structural Foundation:

Implemented a clean HTML5 structure with semantic elements

Created a well-organized CSS architecture using CSS3 variables for theming

Developed a mobile-first responsive design

# Design Implementation:

Applied the provided color palette (#0A1128, #001F54, #034078, #1282A2, #FEFCFB)

Used Montserrat for headings and Open Sans for body text as per brand guidelines

Incorporated Font Awesome icons for visual elements

# Component Development:

Built reusable components (cards, navigation, forms)

Implemented interactive elements with smooth transitions

Created a consistent design language across all sections

# Responsive Enhancements:

Developed a mobile navigation system with hamburger menu

Adjusted layouts and spacing for different viewports

Optimized images and assets for performance

# Challenges Faced
Responsive Alignment:

Initially struggled with aligning the About section image with the text content across different screen sizes

Solved by using CSS Grid with careful margin adjustments and align-items: start

Navigation Behavior:

Implementing smooth scrolling while accounting for the fixed header required precise offset calculations

Added scroll-margin-top to sections to prevent header overlap

Form Validation:

Creating user-friendly validation messages that didn't disrupt the form layout

Implemented a system that shows/hides error messages dynamically

Dynamic Content:

Rendering news articles from a JavaScript array while maintaining design consistency

Ensured all dynamically added elements had proper styling and responsiveness

Cross-Browser Consistency:

Addressed minor rendering differences between browsers

Added vendor prefixes where needed for broader compatibility

Key Features Implemented
Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Accessible navigation with smooth scrolling

Interactive elements with hover effects

Form validation with user feedback

Dynamic content rendering

Professional footer with multiple information sections

The result is a modern, accessible website that effectively showcases the School of Emerging Technologies while providing an excellent user experience across all devices.
